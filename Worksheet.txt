Worksheet:

x change all categorical data into one-hot
x visualize data distribution 
x normalize data
- you can try another model where you delete certain outliers later perhaps. But you should read more about it first.

- create outlines of first rough model:
	- logistic regression model
	- don't use all features immediately, but increment as needed. 
- create infrastructure for model running and testing, evaluating performance
	x cost function
	- optimization function
	- deviding training data into train and dev:
- work out first rough model (don't take more than 1 day)
- visualization of model performance:
	- train and crossval cost against number of iterations
	- is there bias or variance?

- what's next?
