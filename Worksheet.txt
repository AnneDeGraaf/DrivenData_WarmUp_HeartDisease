Worksheet:

x change all categorical data into one-hot
x visualize data distribution 
x normalize data
- you can try another model where you delete certain outliers later perhaps. But you should read more about it first.

- create outlines of first rough model:
	- logistic regression model
	- don't use all features immediately, but increment as needed. 
- create infrastructure for model running and testing, evaluating performance
	x cost function
	- optimization function
	- deviding training data into train and dev:
- work out first rough model (don't take more than 1 day)
- visualization of model performance:
	- train and crossval cost against number of iterations
	- is there bias or variance?


Final/summary notebook:
- You have to add something about how really weird it is that crossval, train and test performance 
	do not give results that are logical in relation to each other. 
		- crossval is not at all reliable value. True performance is always far better that crossval
		- test performance is better indicated by train performance than crossval performance
		- test performace is often even better than train performance. 
- load data
- perform the simple version of linear regression that performed so well
- svm thingy
- Lasso version with optimal C=0.25
- This is obviously not working very well. Try other way of feature selection:
- But first maybe worth trying elastic net? Does Lasso have overfit or underfit in the first place?
- Select K Best with that graph showing is doesn't work very well
- Maybe the contingency tables?
- Forward stepwise feature selection.
- THE END.
