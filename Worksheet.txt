Worksheet:

- change data into all numerical
- visualize data
- normalize data

- create outlines of first rough model
- create infrastructure for model running and testing, evaluating performance
	- cost function
	- optimization function
	- deviding training data into train/crossval/test
- work out first rough model (don't take more than 1 day)
- visualization of model performance:
	- train and crossval cost against number of iterations
	- is there bias or variance?

- what's next?
